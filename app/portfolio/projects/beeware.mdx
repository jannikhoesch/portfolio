I recently had the opportunity to contribute to Toga â€” a native, cross-platform GUI toolkit for Python. Toga enables developers to build beautiful, native user interfaces for desktop, mobile, and web applications with a single, Pythonic API.

## ðŸŽ¯ The Issue

As part of the Software Engineering course we chose an open issue from the open sourve toga project:
The write_text and measure_text methods supported multi-line text, but the spacing between lines couldnâ€™t be customized. This meant developers had no control over text density, which is often critical for designing responsive and accessible interfaces.

## âœ… Our Solution

To address this, we worked to implement a new line_height parameter for the Canvas text methods. This allows developers to specify the line spacing as a ratio of the font size â€” much like the familiar CSS line-height property.

Key aspects of this contribution:
- Precise control: The new parameter lets you fine-tune spacing between lines.
- Backend support: Implemented consistently across macOS (Cocoa), Windows (WinForms), Linux (GTK), Android, and iOS.
- Interactive example: Added a slider to the canvas testbed to demonstrate dynamic line height adjustment.
- Tests & docs: Ensured thorough testing on all supported platforms and updated documentation accordingly.


## Contributions

Thanks to @amaekh, @Trighap52, @karindev and @HaraldHR for the collaboration and great teamwork â€” and of course, to the BeeWare community and @freakboy3742 for guidance.
