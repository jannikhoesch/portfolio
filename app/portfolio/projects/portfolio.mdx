If you’re reading this, it means you’ve already found my website — welcome!

I built this site as a space to share my personal projects, achievements, and stories. Here, you’ll find snapshots of what I’ve been working on, what I’m learning, and where I’m heading next. It’s a place to keep track of my journey in computer science, my experiments with machine learning, and the occasional adventure that happens offline too.

## About
This site is powered by [Vercel’s Portfolio Starter Kit](https://vercel.com/templates/next.js/portfolio-starter-kit) — it’s minimal, fast, and SEO-friendly, but every page carries my own design touches and personality. I wanted something clean and flexible and I believe that the design of my website fulfills these purposes.
