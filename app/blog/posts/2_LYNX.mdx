A full day of the Lynx Hackathon 2025 is officially over. As part of an outreach initiative to introduce students into the Lynx world and the application of systematic strategies in the financial markets, on Saturday, March 29th, Lynx organized its third annual Hackathon.

38 enthusiastic students from 12 diverse educational backgrounds – spanning high school to medicine – were welcomed to the Lynx headquarters to work in teams to develop a fully systematic trading strategy. They were given a time series based on real market futures data to set position and volatility targets to best deliver good risk adjusted returns. At the end of the event, the algorithms developed by the different teams were tested and evaluated in a virtual environment, allowing all participants to follow how the algorithms would have performed in the real world.

The winning team was determined based on risk-adjusted performance, taking into account the robustness of the strategy to tail risk events.

Carlotta: “Together with my amazing team members I joined a hackathon about financial trading strategies last weekend.
→ I didn’t know how a hackathon works.
→ I didn’t know the first thing about systematic trading.
→ I definitely didn’t know how opening, high, low, close prices and macro data turn into positions.
Still, we applied.
And got accepted, top 10 out of many. Knowing this, was already a win for us.”
