6 months ago me and some friends decided we want to go north - far north. We wanted to go for the real lapland experience. 7 days hiking on skis through the Swedish mountains, kilometers away from civilization and without any mobile connection. What could go wrong thought we? This story is about our adventure and the unforgettable memories we made in this week.

## Arrival

We started our journey in Stockholm, where we took the night train to Abisko. Comparing the weight of our backpacks and the amount of food we brought, we realized we had very different strategies. While some of us tried to bring as little as possible - even coming in flip flops, others packed their whole food and some additional vodka. After one hour delay, we entered the train towards the north and woke up the next day in a winter wonderland. We had one more day to chill before we would start hiking the next day, so we used the time to explore the area around Abisko turiststation and walked on the frozen lake Tornetr√§sk. Finally, we finished off the day with a last real meal from the restaurant and the first of many saunas to come.
